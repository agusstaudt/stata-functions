# Stata functions 
This project aims to develop a set of functions in Stata that will help the user when developing code in his or her work environment. On the one hand, it presents different functions of a practical nature, which help in the organization of Stata projects. On the other hand, the project presents functions that help solve particular problems in more specific scenarios. The functions developed here are the following:
- val_cuit.ado
- gcuant2.do
- notes.ado 
- sintilde.ado
